# Creating an RMarkdown notebook

[R Notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) are Markdown documents which allow users to execute chunks of R code independently and interactively while producing publication quality output. They are an example of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

Create an R Notebook as follows:

**File** -> **New File** -> **R Notebook**

Edit the title of the notebook at the top of the document and try following some of the automatically generated instructions within the notebook. 

In the worked example that follows, we can enter R commands into code chunks and make notes using Markdown code in the main part of the document. 

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible: [handy guide to Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
