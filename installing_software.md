# Installing the software

Many users of R use it from within another free piece of software called **RStudio.**
RStudio is a powerful and productive user interface for R. Itâ€™s free and open source, and works great on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Rstudio's version control functionality is provided by yet another software called **git**

Our first task, therefore, is to install R, RStudio and git.

### Install R

Install R first. Downloads are available at https://cran.rstudio.com/
  * Direct link for Windows https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
  * Direct link for MacOS X https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
  * Direct link for Linux https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/

### Install RStudio

Next, install RStudio. **If you already have RStudio, make sure you have the latest version (1.0.44).** The R Notebook used in later lessons will not work in earlier versions.

* Downloads are available at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

### Installing R packages

We are going to be using a number of packages in the following example. To install these packages, run the following code in the R console.

`install.packages(c("RCurl", "readr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "broom", "ggplot2", "cowplot"))`

### Install git

Git is one of the most popular version control systems in the world. It is free and open source.

* Windows & OS X: http://git-scm.com/downloads
* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git-core`
* Fedora/RedHat: `sudo yum install git-core`

To check that the installation worked, open a terminal or command prompt:

**Windows**

* Go to the Start menu
* In the Search or Run line type **cmd** and press enter.

**Mac**

* Go to **Applications** -> **Utilities** -> **Terminal**

Type `git version`. You should see a short message containing some version information.

### Configure git

After installing git, you need to tell it who you are. Open a terminal window or command prompt (see above) and type the following:

```
git config --global user.email "you@youremail.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

On succesful completion, you should see no output from these commands.

You can also configure git to use your preferred editor for commit messages, e.g. on a Mac:

```
git config --global core.editor nano
```

or on Windows:

```
git config --global core.editor notepad
```

It's a good idea to follow this step since the default editor selected by git is quite difficult to use!

### Sign up for an account on GitHub

GitHub is a popular online hosting service for git repositories. It provides a useful interface for collaboration and code sharing.

Create a free account on GitHub:

[https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)

***If you have an academic email account you should use it here.***
GitHub users can create an unlimited number of free, public repositories but only a limited number of private repositories. However, academic users can request access to an unlimited number of free private repositories.

**Optional**

If you are an academic user, sign up for free private repositories here:

[https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)

***This requires your account to be associated with an academic email address.***

It may take a while to receive the verification email for this step. Don't worry, we won't need this for the tutorial.
