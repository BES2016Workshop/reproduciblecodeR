# Additional resources

I hope that you’ve found this guide to making your research more reproducible with R helpful. There are plenty of links throughout to learn more about the packages I've talked about. If you’d like to learn more about R or about reproducibility, I’d highly recommend the following resources:

- [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): includes ggplot2, RMarkdown, dplyr, tidyr and more

- [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/): tutorials for tidyr, dplyr and much more directly in the R console

- [Python pandas comparison with R](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/comparison_with_r.html): Python can be quicker than R, and so is particularly useful when you have a large dataset. This website provides a more detailed look at the R language and its many third party libraries as they relate to the python pandas library

- [Software Carpentry lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/): freely available lessons taught on the Software Carpentry courses. To host or run a workshop also see this site.

- [Reproducible Research on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research): taught by Roger Peng, Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo at Johns Hopkins University
