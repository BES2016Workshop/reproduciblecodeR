# Installing the software

Many users of R use it from within another free piece of software called **RStudio.**
RStudio is a powerful and productive user interface for R. Itâ€™s free and open source, and works great on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Rstudio's version control functionality is provided by yet another software called **git**

Our first task, therefore, is to install R, RStudio and git.

**Install R**

Install R first. Downloads are available at https://cran.rstudio.com/
  * Direct link for Windows https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
  * Direct link for MacOS X https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
  * Direct link for Linux https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/

**Install RStudio**

Next, install RStudio. If you already have RStudio, ensure you have the latest version (1.0.44).

* Downloads are available at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

**Install git**

Git is one of the most popular version control systems in the world. It is free and open source.

* Windows & OS X: http://git-scm.com/downloads
* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git-core`
* Fedora/RedHat: `sudo yum install git-core`

**Configure git**

After installing git, you need to tell it who you are. Open a terminal window (**cmd.exe on windows**) and type the following

```
git config --global user.email "you@youremail.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

On succesful completion, you should see no output from these commands.

**Installing R packages**

We are going to be using a number of packages in the following example. To install these packages, run the following code in the R console.

`install.packages(c("RCurl", "readr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "broom", "ggplot2", "cowplot"))`
